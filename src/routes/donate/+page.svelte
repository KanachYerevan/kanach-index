    <h1>Donate</h1>
    <p>Kanach Yerevan is a volunteer-run organization and relies on donations to continue its work. We spend the money on the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Helping people grow proper lawns and plant trees. We buy seeds and additional materials.</li>
        <li>Building nesting boxes and insect hotels. We need wood for that.</li>
        <li>Mapping more streets. We need some additional hardware to do this efficiently, like a 360 camera and an RTK kit.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can help us by donating any amount to our IDram account: <strong>12345678</strong>.</p>
