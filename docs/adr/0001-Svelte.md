# ADR 0001: Using Svelte

* **Status:** accepted
* **Date:** 2025-10-15

## Context

We need to choose a frontend framework for this project.
The goal is to develop the application quickly and efficiently.

## Decision

We will use Svelte for the frontend framework.

## Rationale

The decision to use Svelte is based on the current team's expertise.
I have significant experience with Svelte and have successfully used it in numerous other projects.
This familiarity will allow for rapid development and a more efficient workflow.
No other frameworks were evaluated to save time and leverage existing skills.

## Consequences

**Pros:**
* Faster development lifecycle due to existing expertise.
* Reduced learning curve for the current team.
* Consistent technology stack with other projects maintained by the team.

**Cons:**
* We might be missing out on potential benefits of other frameworks.
* Future team members might not have Svelte experience.
